# Operationalizing-Machine-Learning
In this project, we are working with the Bank Marketing dataset. We use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. Then, we also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. 
We follow the below steps:
1- Authentication
2- Automated ML Experiment
3- Deploy the best model
4- Enable logging
5- Swagger Documentation
6- Consume model endpoints
7- Create and publish a pipeline
8- Documentation
